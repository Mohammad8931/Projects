# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This machine learning project identifies fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced algorithms and data analysis techniques. The system compares traditional machine learning with deep learning approaches to achieve optimal fraud detection performance.

## Project Description

The project addresses the critical challenge of financial fraud detection in highly imbalanced datasets where fraudulent transactions represent less than 0.2% of all transactions. The system implements both Logistic Regression and Neural Network models to provide comprehensive fraud detection capabilities.

## Dataset Characteristics
- **Total Transactions**: 284,807 credit card transactions
- **Fraudulent Cases**: 492 transactions (0.172% of dataset)
- **Features**: 30 numerical features (28 PCA-transformed + Time + Amount)
- **Time Period**: 2-day European cardholders transaction history
- **Challenge**: Extreme class imbalance requiring specialized techniques

## Technical Implementation

### Data Preprocessing
- **Feature Scaling**: RobustScaler for Amount feature (outlier-resistant)
- **Time Normalization**: Standardized time values for consistent analysis
- **Data Splitting**: Chronological split (240K train, 22K validation, 22K test)
- **Class Balancing**: Techniques to handle extreme imbalance

### Model Architectures

#### 1. Logistic Regression Baseline
```python
# Baseline model with class weight balancing
lr_model = LogisticRegression(
    class_weight='balanced',
    max_iter=1000,
    random_state=42
)
```

#### 2. Neural Network Model
```python
# Deep learning approach
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(30,)),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Dropout(0.2),
    Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | Logistic Regression | Neural Network |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Overall Accuracy** | 99.91% | 99.95% |
| **Precision (Fraud)** | 79% | 88% |
| **Recall (Fraud)** | 61% | 73% |
| **F1-Score (Fraud)** | 69% | 80% |
| **Training Time** | 2 seconds | 45 seconds |
